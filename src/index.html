    <h3>Heres What I Do</h3>
    <p>I've learned the basics of programming and web development from several online learning sites including Lynda.com, freeCodeCamp, Codeschool.com, and various Udemy and Coursera courses. I've learned by building projects from these courses and some of my own. I have also learned many other skills in the digital and tangible relms through online courses. I'm enrolled at CCSF. I'm a life-long learner.
